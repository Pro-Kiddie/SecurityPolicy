# Security Policy Assignment

This is a fulfillment for one of my school modules.  

Information security policies are paramount in shaping the security posture of an organisation and hence ensuring its ability to meet business goals.

Drafting and maintaining security policies often fall within the job scope of the Chief Security Officer of a company. After building a strong technical skill background, management role is often the next-to-go.

The document covers various policies for a fake company called "LET". The background information of this company is outlined in the Introduction section of the report.  All the following policies are written with the context established in the Introduction.

The document covers the following policies:

1. Data Security Policy
2. Acceptable Use Policy
3. Physical Security Policy
4. Software Security Policy
5. Server Security Policy
6. Password Protection Policy
7. Remote Access Policy
8. Disaster Recovery and Backup Policy
9. Incident Response Policy
10. Security Audit Policy
11. Security Awareness Policy

***This document is shared for anyone who wants to refer to sample policies or interested in the process of drafting policies for an organisation. A reference will be great, just like how I referenced so many other policies. :laughing:***
